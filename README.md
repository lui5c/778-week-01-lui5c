## Dubious Goodwill of Nonprofit Organizations
[link to article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2022-10-31/News_and_notes)

The Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) is a nonprofit that is connected to Wikipedia. Every time that you see a banner ad soliciting donations to Wikipedia, the organization that is receving the money is WMF. The amount of staff, solicited donations, and grants the WMF has given out in the past ten years has skyrocketed compared with how much money was flowing out in years prior. The article goes in-depth to show that while Wikipedia's mission is noble (and undoubtedly attracting the dollars of donors), WMF has been unsure of what to do with its large sums of donated money, with an unspent ~$4m going to a charity in a donation by WMF that was not publicizied. 

Wikipedia's language in soliciting donations very clearly positions itself as an underdog in the larger-internet game, and most likely is the result of the large amounts of well-meaning donations that WMF receives from everyday people (myself included!). 

Shady operations by any nonprofit undermine the relationship between the world at large and the organizations runnning the moral operations.
